excerpt: 'Different theories and case studies show the importance of coordination, evidence-based decisions, teamwork, and preparedness for successful public administrations. However, governments rarely had to face such unstable and chaotic situations as during the first months of the pandemic. In Palmira, a medium-sized city in Colombia, Covid-19 arrived rapidly, and the municipality had to make decisions before the national government defined its plan.
One of the main challenges for public administrators was the lack of preparation and technical information describing the implications of the virus and its evolution. Also, the disease's consequences and the policies outcomes did not affect all populations equally. For this reason, it was necessary for the government of Palmira, which had been in office for less than three months when the pandemic started, to set the administrative capacity that would handle the situation while transmitting its new style of government characterized by active two-way communications with citizens and the use of technological aids.   
From a practitioner's perspective, this document pursues to describe how Palmira established a coordination scheme for its cabinet focused on four fundamental aspects: health, economic reactivation, social, and control. The main contribution of this document is to show how a new government, without the necessary technological resources and information sources, in a city with already many social problems, was able to face the pandemic and be recognized by the national government for its good practices.'
